# SLAYER Puzzle Solver

This is my first python project. 

## How it works:
1. The user is prompted to enter a 6-digit number, which represents the digits assigned to the letters in "SLAYER."

2. The script checks if three times this number forms the correct "LAYERS" sequence.

3. It prints whether the equation holds true or false.


### Variables:
- S, L, A, Y, E, R represent digits from the input number.

- The script calculates the equation SLAYER * 3 = LAYERS and verifies if it's correct.


## Example:
```bash
Solve: SLAYER + SLAYER + SLAYER = LAYERS
What is your guess? 142857
LAYERS = 428571 == SLAYER * 3 -> True
